    Preamble

The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users
the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this
license within the framework of an open source distribution model.

The exercising of this right is conditional upon certain obligations
for users so as to preserve this status for all subsequent
redistributions.

In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided
only with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of
the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited
liability.

In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using,
modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user
are brought to the user's attention, given its Free Software status,
which may make it complicated to use, with the result that its use
is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-
depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and
test the suitability of the software as regards their requirements in
conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be
ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same
conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and
published, provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are
either added or removed herefrom.

This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder
of the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its
provisions.
